Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie,

- A professional web developer and mathematics graduate passionate about creating dynamic, intelligent, user-centric websites and dashboards.

- My preferred development stack is `Django` with `React` which I use in my spare time, and work full-time as a `.NET` developer. All of the commits on Github reflect commits made outside of 'working hours'.

- I'm heavily interested in **Cryptocurrency** and the **Stock Market** and I'm continually developing my knowledge of financial markets, trading and investing, as well as pursuing the most relevant software skills to aid my investment strategies programmatically.

- My main project 'SparkTraders', (in a private repository) is a fully bootstrapped cryptocurrency tracking and monitoring website / dashboard, pictured below. sparktraders.crypto (coming 2022)
