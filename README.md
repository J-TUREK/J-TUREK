- I'm passionate about creating dynamic, intelligent websites and dashboards, with a strong enphasis and enjoyment for data analytics and modelling.

- My preferred web development stack is `Django` with `React`, and work full-time as a `.NET` developer. I use `Python`, particularly `Pandas` and `Numpy` for data analytics.

- I'm heavily interested in **Cryptocurrency** and the **Stock Market** and I'm continually developing my knowledge of financial markets, trading and investing, as well as pursuing the most relevant software skills to aid my investment strategies programmatically.

- My main project 'SparkTraders', (in a private repository) is a fully bootstrapped cryptocurrency tracking and monitoring website / dashboard, pictured below. sparktraders.crypto (coming 2022)
This project has two large components- the web interface, and the underlying algorithms
