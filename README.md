## Hi, I’m Jamie Turek

- I’m a professional web developer who's passionate about creating dynamic, intelligent, modern websites using `Django` and `React`. I develop `ASP.NET` applications professionally.

- 💞️ I'm heavily interested in **Cryptocurrency** and the **Stock Market** and I'm continually developing and learning with the goal of automating the buy / sell process for myself. 

- My goal this year is to publish my Crypto application. [Find out more](https://github.com/J-TUREK/Crypto)
