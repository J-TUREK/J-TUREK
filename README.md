Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie,

- A professional web developer and mathematics graduate who's passionate about creating dynamic, intelligent, modern, user-centric websites and dashboards.

- My preferred development stack is `Django` with `React` which I use in my spare time, and work full-time as a `.NET` developer. All of the commits on Github reflect commits made outside of 'working hours'.

- I'm heavily interested in **Cryptocurrency** and the **Stock Market** and I'm continually developing my knowledge of financial markets, trading and investing, as well as pursuing the most relevant software skills to aid my investment strategies programmatically.

- My previously public repository is now private whilst I begin to promote the website. sparktraders.co.uk (coming 2022)
