Hi, I’m Jamie Turek

- I’m a professional web developer who's interested in creating fast, modern websites using Django and React. I also develop ASP.NET applications professionally.

- 🌱 I’ve recently taught myself React and I plan to make this my primary frontend framework moving forward. 

- 💞️ I'm heavily interested in cryptocurrency and the stock market and I'm interested in automating the buy / sell process for myself. 

- My goal this year is to publish my Crypto application. Find out more: https://github.com/J-TUREK/Crypto
